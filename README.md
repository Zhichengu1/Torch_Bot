# Torch Bot using React and Flask

This project focuses on building an AI chatbot that leverages **PyTorch** for natural language processing (NLP). The application is structured with a **React** frontend and a **Flask** backend, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Features:
- **React Frontend**: The user interface is built with React, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in real-time. Itâ€™s designed for smooth communication with the backend and a user-friendly interface.
  
- **Flask Backend**: The Flask server handles API requests and processes the user's inputs. It uses **PyTorch-based models** to perform word recognition and generate intelligent responses.

- **AI-powered Conversations**: The bot responds to user input by analyzing the text using machine learning models trained with PyTorch, enabling meaningful conversations.

## How it works:
1. The **React** frontend collects user inputs and sends them to the backend via API calls.
2. The **Flask** backend processes the input using PyTorch models for NLP tasks like word recognition and understanding.
3. The backend returns a response, which is then displayed to the user in real-time on the frontend.

## Benefits:
- **Seamless Integration**: The combination of React and Flask ensures smooth communication between the user interface and AI-powered backend.
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can have live, interactive conversations with the bot, powered by advanced natural language processing.
