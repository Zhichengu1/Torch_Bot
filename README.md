# Brief Description

 This project involves the development of an AI chatbot that utilizes PyTorch for natural language processing (NLP) and is integrated with a React frontend and a Flask backend. The React application serves as the user interface, providing an interactive experience where users can chat with the bot in real-time. The Flask backend handles API requests, processes the inputs using PyTorch-based models for word recognition, and sends the bot's responses back to the frontend. The combination of React and Flask ensures a seamless connection between the user interface and the AI-powered backend, enabling smooth, dynamic interactions.
